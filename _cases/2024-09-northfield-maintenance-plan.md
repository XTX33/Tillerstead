The owner splits time between New Jersey and the Pacific Northwest and needed a predictable rhythm that kept the house rent-ready for friends and family. We started by cataloging every fixture, material, and access panel so nothing is a mystery when something breaks.

Each visit now includes a repeatable checklist, photo log, and quick approvals for anything over the preset spend limit. When items fall outside my license (like annual HVAC service) I coordinate with their providers and add the paperwork to the drive so they only have one folder to reference.

Because everything is documented, they can renew insurance, prove maintenance to their lender, and keep tenants confident the home is cared for even when they are away.
