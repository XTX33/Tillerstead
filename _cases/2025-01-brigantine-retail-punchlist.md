The retailer needed a steady hand to get the space approved before inventory arrived. I walked the space with their landlord, converted scribbled notes into a tracked punchlist, and scheduled scope blocks so the client could keep merchandising without stepping over trades.

The bathroom and prep sink areas were the riskiest, so we stripped the saturated drywall, rebuilt the substrate with proper moisture protection, and installed tile that could take abuse. Millwork adjustments, paint corrections, and signage installs filled the rest of the schedule.

Every night the client received site notes with photos, material receipts, and next steps. By the time the landlord walked the space there were no surprises, and the inspection cleared in a single visit.
