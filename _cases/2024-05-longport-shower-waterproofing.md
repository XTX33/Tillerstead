The landlord first called because the downstairs tenant reported ceiling stains that lined up with the primary shower. Once I opened the surround it was clear there was no waterproofing, the plumbing was barely supported, and the drain body had a constant drip.

I documented the tear-out, disinfected the cavity, reframed the corner, and swapped in a new mixing valve so the trim package could match their other bathroom.

After installing the Schluter tray and Kerdi surfaces I performed a 24-hour flood test with photos and timestamps. Large-format porcelain tile was set with leveling clips, epoxy grout, and full silicone change-of-plane joints so there are no weak spots.

The record now lives in their maintenance folder with the signed scope, test log, invoices, and warranty notes so future tenants know exactly how the shower was built.
